Our product, mental health predictor, is an AI-ML model that uses a boosting algorithm (ADABOOST) to predict the user's mental health based on the values entered by the user in an HTMLÂ form. It also includes a bot that actively interacts with the user and provides solutions based on the user's needs. Flask is used to connect the front end (html) and back end (python) (python framework). The model is trained using CSV files.
