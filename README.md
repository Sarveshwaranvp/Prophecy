Our product, mental health predictor, is an AI-ML model that uses a boosting algorithm (ADABOOST) to predict the user's mental health based on the values entered by the user in an HTMLÂ form. It also includes a bot that actively interacts with the user and provides solutions based on the user's needs. Flask is used to connect the front end (html) and back end (python) (python framework). The model is trained using CSV files. The dataset which is used in this model is collected by our team in the real time and later the data which contains strings as input is converted into binary values(0,1) in order to fit the model.
